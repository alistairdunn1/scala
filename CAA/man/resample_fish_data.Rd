\title{Resample Fish Data for Bootstrap (Sex-Aware)}
\usage{
resample_fish_data(fish_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{fish_data}{A data frame containing fish measurement data with columns such as stratum, sample_id, length, male, female, unsexed, total, sample_weight_kg, total_catch_weight_kg}
}
\value{
A data frame of resampled fish data with new sample IDs for each bootstrap replicate.
}
\description{
Resamples fish data for bootstrap analysis by resampling samples within each stratum and fish within each sample, with replacement. Sex columns are preserved.
}
\details{
The function performs two-stage resampling:
  \enumerate{
    \item Samples are resampled with replacement within each stratum.
    \item Fish within each sample are resampled with replacement if more than one fish is present.
  }
New sample IDs are assigned in the format "stratum_boot_i" for each bootstrap replicate. Sex columns are retained.

\examples{
\dontrun{
fish_data <- data.frame(
  stratum = c("A", "A", "B", "B"),
  sample_id = c(1, 1, 2, 2),
  length = c(20, 25, 22, 28),
  male = c(2, 1, 3, 2),
  female = c(2, 1, 2, 1),
  unsexed = c(1, 1, 2, 1),
  total = c(5, 3, 7, 4)
)
resampled <- resample_fish_data(fish_data)
