\title{Resample Fish Data for Bootstrap Analysis}
\usage{
resample_fish_data(fish_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{fish_data}{Data frame with fish observation data including columns: stratum, sample_id, length, male, female, unsexed, total}
}
\value{
Resampled fish data frame with the same structure as input
}
\description{
Resamples fish data for bootstrap uncertainty estimation by resampling samples within each stratum.
}
\details{
The function performs bootstrap resampling by:
1. Identifying unique samples within each stratum
2. Resampling samples with replacement within each stratum
3. Returning the resampled data while preserving the original data structure

This resampling approach maintains the hierarchical structure of the data (strata > samples > fish observations)
which is important for proper uncertainty estimation in the length composition calculations.
