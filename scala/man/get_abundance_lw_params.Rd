\title{Get abundance-based length-weight parameters}
\usage{
get_abundance_lw_params()
}
\value{
List containing length-weight parameters for males, females, and unsexed fish.
  Each element is a named vector with components:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{a}: Scaling parameter (set to 1)
    \item \code{b}: Exponent parameter (set to 0)
  }
}
\description{
Returns length-weight parameters that effectively disable weight scaling,
providing abundance (count) calculations instead of weight-based scaling.
}
\details{
This function returns parameters where a=1 and b=0 for all sex categories,
which results in the length-weight relationship: Weight = 1 * Length^0 = 1.
This effectively provides a constant weight of 1 for all fish regardless of length,
making the scaling process abundance-based rather than biomass-based.

This is particularly useful when:
\itemize{
  \item Working with abundance indices rather than biomass estimates
  \item Length-weight relationships are unknown or unreliable
  \item You want to scale by fish counts rather than estimated weights
  \item Conducting sensitivity analyses comparing abundance vs. biomass scaling
}
}
\examples{
# Get abundance-based parameters
abundance_params <- get_abundance_lw_params()

# Use in length composition calculation for abundance scaling
\dontrun{
results <- calculate_length_compositions_bootstrap(
  fish_data = your_fish_data,
  strata_data = your_strata_data,
  lw_params_male = abundance_params$male,
  lw_params_female = abundance_params$female,
  lw_params_unsexed = abundance_params$unsexed,
  bootstraps = 300
)
}
